# Mosquito Repellent System
The Mosquito Repellent System is an innovative project designed to provide a reliable and effective solution for repelling mosquitoes. This open-source project aims to create a system that helps individuals and communities combat the health risks associated with mosquito bites.

The system utilizes a combination of hardware and software components to create a comprehensive mosquito repellent solution. The core functionality revolves around emitting specific frequencies and sounds that mosquitoes find repellent, effectively driving them away. By applying this approach, the system aims to provide a non-toxic and eco-friendly alternative to traditional chemical-based repellents.

## Hardware:
1. Arduino Mega 2560: The Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller is a crucial component of the project as it provides the necessary processing power and control to drive the ultrasonic piezoelectric disks and LEDs. Its high memory and input/output capabilities make it an ideal choice for controlling complex systems such as the mosquito repellent system.

2. Piezo Electric Disks: Piezoelectric disks are electronic components that can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. When pressure or vibration is applied to the disk, it produces an electric charge that can be used in various applications such as sensors, speakers, and in this case, mosquito repellent systems.

3. Rechargeable Battery: The rechargeable batteries and battery holder are significant components in the project as they provide a reliable and sustainable power source for the mosquito repellent system. By using rechargeable batteries, the system can operate for longer periods of time without the need for frequent replacements or disposal, making it more environmentally friendly and cost-effective.

## Limitation:
<ul>
  <li>
    The effectiveness of ultrasonic sound waves in repelling mosquitoes may vary depending on factors such as the type of mosquito and the environment.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    The range of the ultrasonic sound waves may be limited, which means that the system may not be effective in repelling mosquitoes that are outside the range of     the piezoelectric disks.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    The system may not be effective in completely eliminating mosquitoes in an area and may need to be used in conjunction with other mosquito control methods.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    The effectiveness of the system may vary depending on the species of mosquitoes in the area, as some mosquitoes may be less affected by ultrasonic sound           waves. However, this can be overcome by using additional methods in combination with the ultrasonic repellent system.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    The use of rechargeable batteries may require frequent recharging, which may be inconvenient for some users.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Some parts of the project were bought mainly to avoid project failures. The plan was to use 8 piezoelectric disks for more efficient and effective                 results, but due to lack of space, 8 piezoelectric disks could not be implemented. Rather only 4 were used.
  </li>  
</ul>

## Future Endevours
The development of a mosquito repellent system using ultrasonic sound waves and an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller offers a sustainable and effective alternative to traditional methods of mosquito control. The system is portable, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective, making it suitable for use in various settings. While there are some limitations to the system, such as reduced effectiveness in range, overall, the project has demonstrated the potential for using technology to address important issues related to public health and the environment.

For future endeavors, the mosquito repellent system could be further optimized in,

<ul>
  <li>
    Improve the range and effectiveness of the ultrasonic sound waves to enhance the system's performance.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Develop a more user-friendly interface for controlling and monitoring the system.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Conduct further research and testing to optimize the system for different mosquito species and environments.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Explore the potential for integrating other mosquito control methods, such as trapping or sterilization, into the system.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Expand the use of the technology to other insect and pest control applications, such as in agriculture or household pests.
  </li>  
</ul>
